      <description>Introduction The aim of this semi-formal article is to obtain some insights into sentencing in NZ, and establish if and what demographic-based characteristics exist, while demonstrating my workflow and thought process.
Obtaining the Data The Source A quick google took me to Stats NZ, where I found what appeared to be their data extraction portal NZ.Stat.
This data portal was split into several &amp;ldquo;themes&amp;rdquo;, which was useful in enabling me to navigate to the base table Adults convicted in court by sentence type - most serious offence calendar year.</description>

      <description>Rosetta Code has over 800 programming tasks to solve. Although D has solved many of those tasks already, I thought it would be an interesting exercise to see how I&amp;rsquo;d go about solving them myself.

      <description>Introduction When I was younger, I used to play a word game called Boggle, where one would try to find as many words as possible from random letters. I had always suspected that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t good at the game; luckily for me, Wordament, Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s online multiplayer tournament version, left me in no doubt at all.
